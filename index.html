                <p style="line-height: 1.5 " class="video-description"> This project was completed by a team of four for my first-ever fellowship, CUNY Tech Prep (CTP). CTP hosted a hackathon with the theme of art. Our thought process centered on how we could integrate art and technology. We decided to create an easy-to-use platform for artists to sell their art. <br>

                <p style="line-height: 1.5 "class="video-description"> This project was completed by a team of four under the mentorship of Professor Delaram Kahrobaei. Our task was to create a platform to unite all CUNY students. One feature that would be beneficial for both students and professors is having professors post internship opportunities directly on the website or app. This would allow any student who meets the criteria to apply for internships from their freshman year of college, providing them with valuable guidance from experienced individuals. <br> Here is the <a id="link3" href="https://github.com/Khaled2143/SpringFowardProject" target="_blank">Github</a></p>

                <p  style="line-height: 1.5 " class="video-description">This was my first experience with game development. I've always loved video games, playing them since I was young and continuing to enjoy them today. Although I had previously tried using Unreal Engine, I found it too complex for a beginner. However, creating Alien Invaders using Unity provided me with a solid understanding of object-oriented programming. <br>
